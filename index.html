    <h1>The Use of INNER JOIN in SQL<h1>
      <p>INNER JOIN is a keyword within the SQL language that is used to select records that have matching values in both tables; the 
         output is another table with the two or more desired records. Both tables, along with the columns within them that are to be 
         selected, with the SELECT command. Then the first table is referenced within the FROM command, the second table follows within
         the INNER JOIN command. Lastly the ON keyword is used in order to reference the column of data that both tables hold in common.
         The two table columns are set equal to eachother so that the desired columns of data can be properly related.</p>
